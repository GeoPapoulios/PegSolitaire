This code solves the PegSolitaire board game using two different AI algorithms & comparing their effeciency as the number of pegs in the game increases. 
The algorithms are the depth-first search & the best-first Search. I recommend you to read the file Computational.docx, the heuristic used by the best-first search,
the layout of the input files, the comparison between the two approaches is extensively described there.

The code is full of comments, guiding the reader step by step on how the program manages to solve the given PegSolitaire problem.
